# The Linux File System

Linux doesn't have a physical drive (such as the C:drive that windows uses), instead, Linux uses a logical file system. The top of the filesystem is /, that is called ***root of the filesystem.***

The structure is:

-  /root The home directory of the greatest user in Linux, the root user.
- /etc Contain Linux configurations that controls when and how the programs start up.
- /home The users home directory
- /mnt To mount file systems to the current filesystem 
- /media Where CD's
- /bin Where application binaries (like .exe in Windows) are stored to be executed.
- /lib Here you find
